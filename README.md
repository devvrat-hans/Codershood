# Codershood - Your One-Stop Coding Platform (Work-in-Progress)

**Codershood** is a platform I'm building out of my passion for coding and creating something that helps fellow developers. Right now, it's still in development, but the goal is to create a one-stop place where you can practice coding, participate in daily contests, and engage with a growing community of coders.

## What‚Äôs Coming? 

While **Codershood** is still under construction, here's a preview of what the platform will offer once it's up and running:

- **1000+ Coding Problems**: A vast library of problems for all skill levels, designed to help you practice and level up your coding skills.
- **Daily Coding Contests**: Compete in fun challenges, track your performance, and see how you stack up against others on the leaderboard.
- **Active Community**: A place where coders can share solutions, ask questions, and learn from each other.
- **Leaderboard**: Track your progress and challenge yourself to climb the ranks.
- **Forum**: A space for discussions, questions, and collaborative learning.

## Why Codershood? 

I‚Äôve been working on this project because I think it‚Äôs important to have a space where people can learn and grow together, especially when it comes to coding. I wanted to create a platform that not only helps you solve problems but also brings a community together to motivate and support each other.

### Key Features (Coming Soon!):

- **Coding problems** ranging from easy to difficult, across different programming topics.
- **Daily coding contests** to challenge yourself and earn your place on the leaderboard.
- **Community forums** where you can ask questions, discuss solutions, and share ideas.
- **Leaderboards** to keep track of your progress and see how you compare to others.

## How to Get Involved 

Even though the platform is still under development, there‚Äôs plenty of room for you to get involved! Here's how you can help out:

### 1. Report Bugs 

If you come across any issues or bugs while using the platform, **please let me know**! As I'm still building, your feedback is essential in making Codershood better.

- **Email me** directly at [helloworld.codershood@gmail.com](mailto:helloworld.codershood@gmail.com) with any bugs or problems you encounter.

### 2. Contribute to the Code 

- If you have experience with web development (especially front-end and back-end), you can contribute by forking the repo and submitting pull requests.
- Look for **open issues** or suggest new features that would improve the platform.
- I would love help with adding new features, fixing bugs, or even improving the design.

### 3. Spread the Word 

Even though it's still being built, feel free to share **Codershood** with others! Whether it‚Äôs on Twitter, Facebook, or any other platform, help me build a community around this project.

### 4. Suggest New Features 

If you have ideas or features you want to see on Codershood, I‚Äôm all ears! I‚Äôm still in the early stages, so your input could really help shape the platform.

- Open an issue on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/devvrat-hans/Codershood) or reach out to me directly with your suggestions.

## How to Contribute 

### 1. Clone the Repository

#### Steps to Clone the Repository:

1. **Go to the GitHub Repository**:  
   Navigate to the Codershood project on GitHub. For example, if it‚Äôs hosted under your account:
   - `https://github.com/devvrat-hans/Codershood`

2. **Copy the Clone URL**:
   - Click the green "Code" button on the repository page.
   - Copy the HTTPS URL (or SSH, if you're using SSH keys):
     ```
     https://github.com/devvrat-hans/Codershood.git
     ```

3. **Clone the Repo to Your Local Machine**:
   - Open your terminal (Command Prompt, Git Bash, or your preferred terminal).
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project (e.g., `cd ~/Projects`).
   - Run the `git clone` command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/devvrat-hans/Codershood.git
     ```
   - This will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.

### 2. Create a New Branch

Before making any changes, it‚Äôs important to **create a new branch**. This helps keep your work separate from the main codebase and makes it easier to create a pull request later.

#### Steps to Create a New Branch:

1. Navigate to the cloned project directory:
   ```bash
   cd codershood
   ```

2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name for the changes you're making:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature-branch
   ```
   Replace `my-feature-branch` with a name relevant to the changes you're going to make (e.g., `fix-typo`, `add-new-feature`, `update-footer`, etc.).

3. Now you're on a new branch, and you're ready to make your changes!

### 3. Make Your Changes

Now you can modify the code locally using your text editor or IDE. Make the changes you'd like to contribute, whether it's fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or improving documentation.

Once you‚Äôve made your changes:

1. **Stage the Changes**:
   Use `git add` to stage the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   This stages all modified files. You can also stage specific files:
   ```bash
   git add path/to/file
   ```

2. **Commit the Changes**:
   Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Brief description of what I changed"
   ```

### 4. Push Your Changes to GitHub

Once your changes are committed locally, you‚Äôll need to **push** them to GitHub so you can create a pull request.

#### Steps to Push:

1. **Push to Your Remote Branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin my-feature-branch
   ```

   This will push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub in the new branch you created earlier.

### 5. Create a Pull Request (PR)

Now that your branch is pushed to GitHub, it's time to create a pull request to propose your changes to the main repository.

#### Steps to Create a PR:

1. **Go to the GitHub Repository**:  
   Visit the repository page on GitHub, where you pushed your branch. For example, `https://github.com/devvrat-hans/Codershood`.

2. **Open the Pull Requests Tab**:
   Click on the "Pull Requests" tab near the top of the page.

3. **Click "New Pull Request"**:
   - Click the green "New Pull Request" button.
   - Select the **base branch** (the branch you want to merge into). This is usually `main` or `master`.
   - Select your **compare branch** (the branch with your changes), which is the branch you created earlier (e.g., `my-feature-branch`).

4. **Add a Title and Description**:
   - Add a **clear title** that describes your changes.
   - In the **description**, explain what changes you made and why. Be clear about any modifications you‚Äôve done, including new features or bug fixes.

5. **Submit the PR**:
   Once you're happy with everything, click the "Create Pull Request" button.

### 6. Wait for Review

Once your pull request is created, project maintainers will review it.

- They may leave comments or suggest changes.
- If changes are needed, you can **edit your branch** and push new commits, and they‚Äôll automatically update the pull request.

### 7. Merge the PR

If the pull request is approved, a maintainer will merge it into the main branch.

- You‚Äôll typically see a **Merge** button once the PR is approved.
- If you don‚Äôt have permission to merge, the maintainer will do it.
